# UFOs
# Project overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create an interactive webpage that displays the UFO Sightings data into a table. The user can filter the data based on multiple criteria and obtain an instant result.
We have created the table and created the filter search with the help of JavaScript and our html page.

# Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: E6+,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,D3 libraries

# Results

The [UFO Sighting(file:///C:/Users/19055/Desktop/Data_analytics/homework/UFOs/index.html)]  was created in a sense that we used a specific image for the background of our webpage which was related to the topic of the data provided.

An update of the html page and the javascript file was done to unable any user of the webpage to filter the data based on the following:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape
# Summary

## Drawbacks

This new design although great might is has a source of data that is outdated and limited since its not linked to a live source
The search field is case sensitive this limits the user as one will have to know the exact spelling of the word being searched which becomes an issue as its purpose was to save time and avoid the user having to go through the data to search for the exact word.

## Recommendations for further development:

- Add additional customization such as dropdown list to make the page more interactive
- Add a functionality to get the data from a live source and expand the data to worldwide as opposed to it being limited to the US
